##### We can draw three major differences between June and Deceber on Oahu, Hawaii:
      1: Average temperature in June is 4F higher than December
      2: Minimum temperature in June is 9F higher than December
      3: Maximum temperature in July is only 2F higher than December, 
         but when we look at the distribution of temp in July is belongs to normal distribution. 
         Meaning that in July there is more days with higher temperature which beneficial for Surfs shop and ice cream shop.
